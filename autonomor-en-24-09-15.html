		<strong>Pakhomov's Autonomor: A Philosophy of Honorable Freedom</strong>
	</h2>
	<p>(Sunday 15 September 2024)</p>
	<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
	<p><strong>Pakhomov's Autonomor</strong> is a philosophy rooted in
		the principles of <strong>personal freedom</strong>, <strong>free
			will</strong>, and the pursuit of a life that is lived with <strong>honor
			and authenticity</strong>. Created by <strong>Vladimir Alexandre
			Pakhomov</strong>, the philosophy emphasizes the importance of
		<strong>autonomy</strong> and <strong>integrity</strong> in aligning
		one’s actions with their deepest desires and values. <strong>Autonomor</strong>
		encourages individuals to act with dignity, pursue their dreams, and
		understand the dynamic interplay between <strong>fate</strong>, <strong>free
			will</strong>, and <strong>human nature</strong>. In doing so,
		individuals can leave a meaningful impact on the world, defining
		their existence through their choices.
	</p>


	<h3><strong>Core Principles</strong></h3>
	<p><strong>Autonomor</strong> is founded on four key principles: <strong>free
			will</strong>, <strong>truth to one’s desires</strong>, <strong>honor</strong>
		driven by the pursuit of dreams, and the dynamic nature of <strong>fate</strong>.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Free Will as the Ultimate Guide</strong><br />
				Free
				will is the essential force that shapes our existence. In <strong>Autonomor</strong>,
				individuals are free to make choices that align with their personal
				values and ambitions. <strong>Free will</strong> is the engine of
				self-expression, allowing individuals to actively shape their lives
				and futures. By embracing one’s freedom, people have the power to
				pursue their dreams, confront adversity, and live authentically,
				despite the constraints imposed by fate.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Truth to One’s Desires</strong><br />
				<strong>Living
					truthfully</strong> means aligning your actions with your deepest
				desires and ambitions. In <strong>Autonomor</strong>, life is not
				about adhering to societal expectations or surviving within
				predefined roles, but about <strong>self-expression</strong> and
				<strong>courage</strong>. Being true to yourself requires
				acknowledging and acting on your innermost aspirations, even if it
				involves challenging societal norms or confronting obstacles.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Honor Driven by the Pursuit of Dreams</strong><br />
				<strong>Honor</strong>
				in <strong>Autonomor</strong> is not just about maintaining rigid
				ideals but is tied to the pursuit of your <strong>dreams</strong>.
				It’s about having the <strong>courage to act accordingly</strong>,
				even in complex situations where absolute truthfulness may not be
				possible. True honor comes from being <strong>self-aware</strong>
				and recognizing when your actions fall short of your ideals while
				still striving for <strong>alignment with your larger purpose</strong>.
				<strong>Honor is adaptive</strong>, allowing individuals to act in
				ways that serve their dreams and admit when they haven’t been
				entirely true to themselves.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Fate as a Cyclical Force</strong><br />
				<strong>Fate</strong>
				is predetermined, but it’s not a one-way force that moves only
				from the past to the future. In <strong>Autonomor</strong>, fate is
				shaped from both the <strong>start to the end</strong> and the <strong>end
					to the start</strong>. This cyclical nature of fate means that the
				choices we make today are influenced by both the past and the
				future. While fate is unchangeable, it is constantly being <strong>reshaped
					by the choices of individuals</strong> over time. By seeking
				freedom, individuals participate in the <strong>creation of fate</strong>,
				which is predetermined but always evolving.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ol>


	<h3><strong>Human Nature and Morality</strong></h3>
	<p><strong>Autonomor</strong> sees human nature as a balance of
		<strong>self-preservation</strong>, <strong>instinct</strong>, and
		<strong>individual perception</strong>.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Instincts and Social Harmony</strong><br />
				While
				humans are driven by self-interest, their <strong>instincts</strong>
				and <strong>experience</strong> also contribute to <strong>social
					awareness</strong> and <strong>harmony</strong>. This harmony is not
				necessarily driven by <strong>empathy</strong>, but by <strong>aligned
					goals</strong> and mutual recognition of one another's autonomy.
				<strong>Human nature</strong> pushes individuals to avoid
				destructive behaviors, not out of moral obligation, but because
				<strong>instinct</strong> encourages survival, cooperation, and
				self-preservation. However, <strong>evil</strong> or harmful
				behaviors may always exist, as not every individual seeks harmony.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Subjectivity of Morality</strong><br />
				Morality in
				<strong>Autonomor</strong> is <strong>subjective</strong> and based
				on personal experience, not a universal standard. Human behavior is
				shaped by <strong>emotion and logic</strong>, but ultimately,
				<strong>self-interest</strong> drives actions. <strong>Honor</strong>
				and <strong>dignity</strong> take precedence over empathy or
				compassion, meaning that moral decisions are often guided by one’s
				own desires and vision rather than concern for others.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>


	<h3><strong>Social Connections and Human Emotion</strong></h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Social Connections Beyond Empathy</strong><br />
				<strong>Social
					connections</strong> in <strong>Autonomor</strong> are not
				necessarily driven by empathy but by <strong>aligned goals</strong>
				and <strong>mutual respect</strong>. Emotions are seen as <strong>personal
					experiences</strong> that cannot be fully understood or connected
				between individuals. Human emotions are subjective, rooted in
				personal perceptions, and shaped by the meanings assigned to them by
				society. Therefore, while people may work together to achieve common
				goals, they do so without expecting full emotional connection or
				understanding.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Emotional Isolation and Respect for Autonomy</strong><br />
				In
				<strong>Autonomor</strong>, it is recognized that <strong>emotions
					are personal perceptions</strong> that cannot truly be shared or
				connected across individuals. People may relate to each other’s
				emotions based on shared experiences, but true connection is not
				possible because emotions are defined and experienced individually.
				<strong>Respect for autonomy</strong> allows for meaningful social
				connections, even in the absence of deep emotional bonds.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>


	<h3><strong>Truth, Knowledge, and Fate</strong></h3>
	<p><strong>Autonomor</strong> offers a dynamic view of truth,
		knowledge, and fate:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Truth as a Personal Construct</strong><br />
				Truth is
				shaped by individual perception. What one person sees as truth may
				not align with another’s understanding. <strong>Truth</strong> is
				not fixed, but fluid, shifting based on the individual’s
				perception of reality. People create the world they perceive, making
				truth both subjective and flexible.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Fate and the Absence of Randomness</strong><br />
				In
				<strong>Autonomor</strong>, randomness does not exist. Life is the
				result of choices, and <strong>fate</strong> is predetermined from
				both <strong>the end to the start</strong> and <strong>the start to
					the end</strong>. This cyclical nature of fate means that all events
				are intertwined, with past and future influencing one another. Fate
				is <strong>predetermined</strong>, but <strong>free will</strong>
				remains intact because individuals are unaware of their future
				outcomes and can act freely in the present.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Knowledge Expands Free Will</strong><br />
				<strong>Knowledge</strong>
				expands the number of paths available to an individual, providing
				them with tools to make informed choices. However, despite the
				expansion of will through knowledge, <strong>fate</strong> remains a
				product of the choices made across time. Knowledge empowers
				individuals, but fate still guides the larger outcome of those
				choices.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>


	<h3><strong>Society and Leadership</strong></h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Society Built on Shared Goals</strong><br />
				In
				<strong>Autonomor</strong>, society is shaped by <strong>aligned
					goals</strong>. The <strong>most shared goal</strong> will determine
				the <strong>government or leadership</strong> of an area. Leaders
				are those who inspire others to follow a collective vision, and
				rules are created based on the <strong>most common goal</strong> of
				the community. However, honor remains a personal pursuit, driven by
				the <strong>alignment of one’s actions with their dreams</strong>
				and the <strong>self-awareness</strong> to remain accountable for
				one’s decisions.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>


	<h3><strong>Personal Growth and Adversity</strong></h3>
	<p><strong>Autonomor</strong> places great value on <strong>personal
			growth</strong> through self-reflection and overcoming adversity:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Self-Reflection as a Growth Tool</strong><br />
				Personal
				growth is achieved through <strong>constant self-reflection</strong>.
				This practice allows individuals to assess their actions, ensure
				they are on their desired path, and adjust accordingly. <strong>Realizing
					one’s dreams</strong> is the highest form of freedom in <strong>Autonomor</strong>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Dignity in the Face of Adversity</strong><br />
				When
				adversity strikes, maintaining <strong>dignity</strong> is
				essential. Individuals must remain <strong>true to their values</strong>
				while adapting to difficult circumstances. Even when freedom seems
				limited, dignity allows individuals to <strong>navigate hardship
					with honor</strong>, finding better paths through perseverance.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3><strong>Metaphysical
			Beliefs and Spirituality</strong></h3>
	<p>While
		Pakhomov's Autonomor does not incorporate traditional metaphysical
		beliefs, it acknowledges that spiritual symbols can be meaningful for
		others:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Symbolism
					and Personal Meaning</strong>:<br />
				Though
				it does not posit the existence of a metaphysical reality, the
				philosophy recognizes that such beliefs can serve as powerful
				symbols for people. Whether through envisioning a conversation with
				a deceased loved one or finding peace in the cessation of choices,
				spirituality can offer comfort and personal meaning.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>


	<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
	<p><strong>Pakhomov's Autonomor</strong> is a philosophy that
		champions <strong>free will</strong>, <strong>honor</strong>, and the
		pursuit of a <strong>dream-driven life</strong>. It recognizes that
		while <strong>fate is predetermined</strong>, individuals maintain
		their freedom through their actions and choices. <strong>Honor</strong>
		comes not only from staying true to one’s ideals but from the
		<strong>self-awareness</strong> to recognize when flexibility is
		necessary. By understanding the interplay of <strong>fate, free will</strong>,
		and <strong>human nature</strong>, individuals can live powerful,
		purposeful lives that leave a lasting mark on the world.
